# PerkLab Winter Bootcamp 2019

## Logistics

- Date:	2019 Jan 20.
- Time:	10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
- Location:	Goodwin Hall (25 Union Street, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6), room 747.
-	Lunch will be provided (pizza).

## Pre-requisites
-	Prepare with a short introduction about yourself (2-3 minutes, supported by 1-2 slides): experience, research interests, something personal
-	Bring your own laptop. Windows OS is strongly recommended.
-	Install [3D Slicer](http://download.slicer.org/) latest stable version (4.8.1) -> nightly 64-bit installer. After you installed Slicer, start it, open the Extension manager, and install these extensions: SlicerIGT, Sequences, Debugging tools, SlicerElastix, SegmentRegistration, TCIABrowser, Perk Tutor, SlicerDMRI
-	Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) if you bring a Windows computer. On macOS and Linux, Git comes with the OS so all we need is a client. On macOS we recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). On Linux, terminal commands are best. See the "Git on macOS and Unix" pdf for a tutorial.
-	[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) Professional Edition (you can activate it immediately with your university email address), Community version is not suitable (does not support remote debugging)
-	Install latest version of PLUS from: http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/packages/nightly/ -> PlusApp-...-Win64.exe package (the generic version, not Ultrasonix, Telemed, etc.). If you bring a non-Windows computer then you may not be able to follow certain hands-on exercises (less than 2 hours in total).
-	Register a user at www.github.com
